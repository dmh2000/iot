# HIVEMQ QUICKSTART

The 'simple' sample here is right out of the HiveMQ quickstart on their website. So just go [here](https://www.hivemq.com/docs/hivemq/4.7/user-guide/getting-started.html#hivemq-cloud) and use the "Try Out HiveMQ for Free" option.

Once you are signed up with HiveMQ and have the Hivemq Host String, Userid and Password, edit ./hivemq/hivemq-env.sj and add your strings. Source that file to set the environment variables.

Then you can run the 'simple' or 'gps' sample. just go in each, do "npm install" and then "node index.js" for each.
